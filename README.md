## Description

A simple tool that helps manage monthly budget by setting and tracking percentages. We can feed data from a CSV file and download the updated CSV with calculated values.

## Features

- **Monthly Budget Calculation**: Set percentages to manage or see budget reports.
- **CSV Import/Export**: Easily import your budget data from a CSV file and export the updated data.
- **Automatic Calculations**: The app automatically calculates the necessary fields based on the net amount and spent amount.

## Usage

1. **Feed Data from CSV**: Use the provided `csv_example.csv` or manually enter the data.
2. **Net Amount and Spent Amount**: Focus on these fields in your CSV file. The rest will be automatically calculated by the app.
3. **Download Updated CSV**: Once you have updated your budget, download the CSV file with the updated values.
4. **Percentages and Categories**: Can only be set through the CSV for now.
